# React-Day2
There are 2 separate React projects are included:

- `day2` - Here can see everything from the document up until the 5th Exercise(it is included). Reflection to the questions is uploaded in a separate copy of the Day2-Exercise document, in [`the PDF document`](https://github.com/AndrianV/React-Day2/blob/master/Day2_Cos_answers.pdf). (answers are highlighted in blue)

- `images` - This is the last 6th exercise. It is not fully completed though, it is showing random stylised with border and padding pictures on reload, but the button is not finished. I have tried to play with setState(), but unfortunately faced a lot errors :(
